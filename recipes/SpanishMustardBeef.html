        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Despite the awkward name, this fast and user-friendly wet rub did a fine job flavoring some carne asada I grilled recently (yes, that was redundant). I'm calling it Spanish mustard since I spiked the Dijon with a couple of my favorite ingredients of all time: smoked paprika and sherry vinegar. You can use any thin flap meat (flap steak, skirt steak, round steak) instead of the flank steak.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup light olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds very thin flank steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk sherry vinegar, olive oil, mustard, paprika, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Place steak in marinade and turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill, turning once, until each side is browned, steak is beginning to firm, and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steak to a plate and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
