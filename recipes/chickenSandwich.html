        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken burgers are notoriously dry, but not anymore! Adding minced roasted mushrooms to ground 
            chicken not only adds extra moisture, it gives a deep umami flavor that even beef lovers will drool over. 
            A little more time-intensive than a regular burger, this version is oozing with flavor and well worth the 
            extra effort–crunchy, tangy, sweet, savory and juicy, all in one burger. The jalapeños aren't spicy because 
            they are seeded, but if you want an extra kick, leave the seeds in. Save time by making the sauce, slaw 
            and patties ahead of time</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Chili Sauce</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Ground Chicken</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together 3/4 cups rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sesame seeds in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add carrot, cucumber, and red onion, separating onion layers; toss to coat. Chill until ready to use, stirring occasionally to keep vegetables submerged in the brine.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chile sauce, Sriracha, 1 teaspoon rice vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Chill Bang Bang Sauce until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Toss mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast mushrooms in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked mushrooms to a food processor,pulsing 5 or 6 times and scraping down the sides of the bowl, until finely minced (or mince with a knife). Combine mushrooms, ground chicken,  and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt in a bowl; mix thoroughly, without overmixing. Form into 4 patties, about the circumference of the brioche buns, and place on squares of parchment paper or plastic wrap to prevent from sticking. You can oil your hands to handle meat if mixture is sticky. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes for the patties to firm up.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook the burgers, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place jalapeño halves, cut side down, and green onions on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. </li>
        <li>Broil vegetables until charred, turning halfway through, about 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with 1 teaspoon oil and toast brioche buns, cut side down, until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes; set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a light layer of Bang Bang sauce on bottom buns. Add 2 charred jalapeño halves per bun. Add chicken patty and top with slaw and charred scallions. Top with cilantro and drizzle with more sauce.</li>
    </ol>
